## Forced Perspective Photography
You've probably seen photos of [objects that seem bigger or smaller based on the angle of the shot](http://www.instantshift.com/2010/08/24/88-brilliant-examples-of-forced-perspective-photography/) to create an amusing composition. This is my at-home take on it.

### Outside Photography
Forced perspective isn't just used in photography. It might most often be used in filmography and archetecture. It was a key component in the appearance of the [short statures of the hobbits](https://youtu.be/QWMFpxkGO_s) in The Lord of the Rings and it can similarly make certain props look bigger or smaller in frame. In archetecture, you often see forced perspective used to make a structure appear [bigger or longer](https://medium.com/archilyse/1-how-architecture-photography-can-trick-our-perception-e3391ae1063) than it actually is, which also can be applied to sets in film making.
